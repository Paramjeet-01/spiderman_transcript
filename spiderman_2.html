</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Locals say the cyclone had a face.
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>People say things when they're under stress. Okay, that does not mean that this is the start to another big world-
</h1><h1>[A green cloud of smoke appears in front of them. Both pull out their guns, looking towards a strangely dressed man.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Who are you?
</h1><h1>[The Earth Elemental, that appears to be made from rocks, comes from the ground in the village.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You don't want any part of this. [he steps forward, green blasts shooting from his hands]
</h1><h1>[Marvel intro plays to 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston (1963 - 2012). A poorly edited video in tribute of the fallen Avengers, Tony/Iron Man, Steve Rogers/Captain America (although it is unknown that he actually died.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and Vision plays. It shifts to show Midtown School's news show with Betty Brant and Jason Ionello]
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: </b>Gone. <i>But not forgotten. </i>
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: </b>This year has been nothing short of-
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>[a beep blocks out what he said] S**t is crazy. It's like insane.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: </b>Jason.
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>What?
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: </b>No swearing.
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>Yeah, it's like the last day of school, we're good.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: </b>Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High was wiped from existence. But then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. They called it the Blip. Those of us who blipped away came back the same age. But our classmates that didn't blip grew five years older.
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant: (annoyed) </b>Yeah, it's math. And even though we had blipped away half way through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning.
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>Totally unfair. It's not right.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant:</b> Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it's time to move on to a new phase of our lives.
</h1><h1><b>Jason Ionello: </b>Pray nothing crazy happens again because, are the Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan?!
</h1><h1>[In a classroom, Peter sits down next to Ned Leeds.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I have a plan. (enthusiastic) Okay, first, I sit next to MJ on the flight.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Mhm.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Second, I’m gonna buy a dual headphone adapter and watch movies with her the whole time.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Okay.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Three, when we go to Venice, Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass, right?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>True.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>So, I’m gonna buy her a Black Dahlia necklace, because her favorite flower is the Black Dahlia, because of, well...
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>The murder.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I’m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace...
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Oh!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>And then five, I’m gonna tell her how I feel...And then six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Oh! Don’t forget step seven.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>[thinking]<b> </b>Step seven...
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Don’t do any of that.
</h1><h1>[Peter looks up, confused.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Why?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Because we’re gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Ned...
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b> Look, I may not know much, but I do know this: Europeans love Americans.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>...Really?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>And more than half of them are women!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay, sure, but...I really like MJ, man. Okay? She’s awesome, she’s funny in a sort of dark way, and sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I like I’ve feel stood up way too...Wait. Dude, she’s coming now. Just don’t say anything.
</h1><h1>[Michelle Jones walks over to them.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Hey, uh, yeah. We’re just talking about the trip.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Yeah, and Peter’s plan.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>You have a plan?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I don’t-I don't have a plan.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>No, he’s just going to collect tiny spoons while we’re traveling to other countries. (winks at Peter)
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Like a grandmother?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I’m not collecting tiny spoons. He’s collecting tiny spoons.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Oh. Okay, well...that was a real roller coaster.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Mhm...
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>By the way, travel tip: You should probably download a VPN on your phone, just so that the government can’t track you while we’re abroad.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Smart. Will do.
</h1><h1>[MJ leaves.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Dude, I think that went really great!
</h1><h1>[Peter seems to disagree.]
</h1><h1>[In the Homeless Support building, Spider-Man (in his Iron Spider suit) and his Aunt May are on stage.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>When I blipped back to my apartment, the family living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. (the audience laughs) The Grandma thought that I was a ghost. (more laughter) It was, (laughs) it was really a mess. Thank you all for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip, and, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!
</h1><h1>[The audience erupts in applause for Spider-Man. Aunt May gestures Peter to the microphone.]
</h1><h1><b>Spider-Man: </b>Thank you, Ms., for having me. And thank you guys for having me. [Awkwardly gives the audience a thumbs-up.]
</h1><h1>[The audience cheers once more.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>And thank you Spider-Man, and he’ll be right back out to take photos and videos, thank you!
</h1><h1>[Peter and Aunt May head backstage. Peter unmasks himself.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>That was amazing.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>That was great. (high-fives Peter)
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Ah, that was so cool. I was a little nervous!
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>My body was a little stiff, I felt like I wasn’t in the pocket.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, I thought you did great!
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>Yeah, well, actually, I did think you were a little stiff.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>[shrugs]<b> </b>I felt that, too, I felt that, too.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. Did you get your passport?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>Mini toothpaste?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1>[Happy enters. He’s carrying a big check for the homeless.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Hey, sorry I’m late.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Happy, hey!
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>[to May] Oh, you look lovely.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>Thanks, you too.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Thank you. New dress?
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>Uh, yeah. Yes, it is. That’s a new beard.
</h1><h1>[Peter looks back in forth between the two, confused.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>It’s my Blip beard, because I grew it in the blip. Blip beard.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>I see.
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> Anyway, the reason I'm late is because this was misplaced at the office. Can you believe it? Because it's enormous. I mean, not the amount, the size. The amount's nice too.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> (laughs) Oh.
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> The very generous Pepper Potts, said...
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May: </b>Thank you.
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> ...she’s sorry she couldn’t be here.
</h1><h1>[Peter is still looking at them in confusion]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May</b>: I think I’m going to go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna. (to Peter) Spider-Man, go shake hands.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Will do. [turns to Happy as May leaves] What just happened?
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Nick Fury’s going to call me?
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Why?
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Why? Because he probably has some hero stuff for you to do. You’re a superhero. He calls superheroes.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Well, I mean if it was really that important, he’d probably call someone else. Not me.
</h1><h1>[inside Peter’s bag, his phone begins to ring]
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Apparently not. [Peter pulls out his phone from the bag] No caller ID. That’s him.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I don’t really want to talk to Nick Fury.
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Answer the phone.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Why?
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Because if you don’t talk to him, then I have to talk, and I don’t want to talk to him.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Why don’t you want to talk to him?
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Because I’m scared. Just answer the phone! [Peter holds up his phone, and declines the call] You sent Nick Fury to voice mail?
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: You don’t send Nick Fury to voice mail!
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Did you hear that? They’re calling me. I got to go. I got to go.
</h1><h1>[Peter starts to back away]
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: You got to talk to him.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I’m going to call him. I promise you. I’m going to call him. I will.
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: You do not ghost Nick Fury!
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I promise you, I’ll call him. [Peter backs out of the room through the curtains, and whispers to himself] After my trip.
</h1><h1>[Peter puts his iron-mask on as he backs away and turns around to open the curtain. He jumps up as he enters the stage]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Hey! [waves]
</h1><h1>[From the other room, Happy gets buzzed. He puts his phone up to his ear.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy</b>: Yeah? Hi -- No, no, he's not ghosting you.
</h1><h1>[FROM THE STAGE]
</h1><h1>[Reporters crowd all around Peter as he just entered. The crowd is speaking indistinctly. Peter backs away, putting a hand up, so they could stay back.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Okay, one question at a time.
</h1><h1>[Peter points to the Asian woman.]
</h1><h1><b>Woman</b>: Are you the head Avenger?<b> </b>Are you the head Avenger now?
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Uh, no I'm not.
</h1><h1>[He points to another woman, who leans over the crowd of reporters.]
</h1><h1><b>Woman</b>: If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do?
</h1><h1>[Peter looks around.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?
</h1><h1>[Everyone starts asking desperately. He leans in for a man to ask a question, hoping it's a neighborhood question.]
</h1><h1><b>Sean</b>: Sean Wilford, <i>Queens Tribune. </i>What is it like to take over from Tony? Those are some big shoes to fill.
</h1><h1>[His question echoes Peter's mind. Everyone's still asking questions as he has time to think of his answer. He started to have anxiety and feels like he is about to pass out.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I'm uh-- I'm going to go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.
</h1><h1>[He jumps up to the roof, to only find himself on top, looking out onto the city. His mask fades off and he breathes deeply as a large train passes by. A cellphone buzzes in his backpack and he reaches to get it. He never answers and the buzzing stops as he looks back into the city. He turns to his left to see a painting of Iron-Man coming right at him. He blinks as he turns away, feeling the pain and sorrow as he thinks about his long-lost friend.]
</h1><h1>[PETER'S ROOM]
</h1><h1>[An unknown<i> </i>phone number shows up on Peter's cracked phone as he packs his suitcase. He looks at it, but he sets it back down, upset. He pulls a bin from underneath the bed and takes some clothes out and sniffs them as he places it in his suitcase. He gets up, exhausted.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Okay.
</h1><h1>[He stays there for a moment before he turns his head to see his old Spider-Man suit, hanging from his closet. He looks at it. He closes the closet. Suddenly, May comes in with an banana in her hand.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt</b> <b>May</b>: Hungry?
</h1><h1>[She throws the banana at Peter's shoulder. It hits him and he jerks back, petrified. He gasps as he turns around to see May with her hands on her mouth, shocked.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt</b> <b>May</b>: Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha. I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.
</h1><h1>[She points at him with a smile. He sighs, exhausted at that nickname.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Please do not start calling it Peter-tingle.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt</b> <b>May</b>: So what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break.
</h1><h1>[May comes to wrap her arms around Peter's neck. She hugs him.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt</b> <b>May</b>: You deserve it.
</h1><h1>[She rubs his shoulders as she pulls away.]
</h1><h1><b>Aunt</b> <b>May</b>: Yeah. [Turns around] You know what? You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it.
</h1><h1>[Aunt May smirks as she walks away. Peter cringes.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Please stop saying "tingle," May.
</h1><h1>[He looks over at his suit.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: No. [he closes the closet door]
</h1><h1>[He looks over at his new suit that is in a cage. It looks like magic floating around it and a sign behind it says 'Iron Spider Charging Do <u>Not</u> Unplug.' His hand is still on the closet door as he looks at it in deep thought.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: No. No, I'm not.
</h1><h1>[He closes his suitcase.]
</h1><h1>[AIRPLANE]
</h1><h1>As the airplane flies by, we see Peter opening his window and looking out at the view. He smiles happily.
</h1><h1>Ned taps him on the shoulder, excitedly.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Yeah!
</h1><h1><b>Man 1</b>: Can you help me get my stuff up?
</h1><h1><b>Woman 1</b>: Oh, sorry, that's mine.
</h1><h1><b>Man 2</b>: No worries.
</h1><h1>[Betty Brant comes in, waving at some people. Mr. Harrington comes behind her, looking around the place.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell</b>: Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: I can't chaperone these kids alone.
</h1><h1>[Suddenly, a familiar voice can be heard from the other side of the plane. It's Flash Thompson. He held a drink in his hand.]
</h1><h1><b>Flash Thompson</b>: Yo,! This, is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to, [MJ walks by] except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them.
</h1><h1>[MJ leans over to the flight attendant. Brad Davis is with her.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Ma'am?
</h1><h1><b>Flight Attendant</b>: Mm-hm?
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: He blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.
</h1><h1>[Flash Thompson blinks at MJ as the flight attendant reaches to grab his drink out of his hand. He looks down as she grabs it.]
</h1><h1><b>Flight Attendant</b>: I'll take that.
</h1><h1>[People start to laugh as Flash Thompson's eyes are big. He turns to her.]
</h1><h1><b>Flash Thompson</b>: She's lying! I don't even know this girl.
</h1><h1>[MJ turns around to the boys that are sitting there as Flash Thompson leaves. She looks at them and lifts her chin up in a 'hi' kind of way. Brad Davis smiles at them as he passes by.]
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis</b>: Classic MJ, right?
</h1><h1>[Peter looks over at Brad Davis with a creeped out expression as Ned Leeds sits there with a cool one. He turns his head as Peter starts talking.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Did you know Brad was coming?
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds shakes his head.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: It-- It's so weird. Like, one day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him.
</h1><h1>[Peter narrows his eyebrows as they turn back around from watching Brad Davis and MJ put their stuff in the overhead compartments.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Not all the girls are after him.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: No, man. They're all after him.
</h1><h1>[MJ and Brad Davis are helping each other out.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b> [giggling]: Yeah. Here.
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds turns back around.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Anyway, on to more important things. [He unzips his bag. He shows Peter what he has.] It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.
</h1><h1>[Peter looks back at MJ, staring at her for a split second before leaned into Ned's ear to whisper.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I need your help to sit next to MJ.
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds rolls his eyes as he sighs.] [Peter looks back at MJ again.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Seriously?
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Yes, seriously.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: What about all our plan? American bachelors in Europe!
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: That's your plan! That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan.
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds looks at him with solemn eyes. He turns around and back again. Peter looks desperately at him.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Please.
</h1><h1>[Ned rolls his eyes as his head leans back.]
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds gets up from his seat over to MJ and Betty Brant, who are sitting next to each other. They look up at him.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Hey, guys. Uh, there's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies. Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be--
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: He's allergic to perfume?
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds stays silent and shakes his head.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Yeah, yeah, because it-- it makes his eyes water, and he can't really--
</h1><h1>Mr. Harrington turns around in his seat after eavesdropping on the conversation.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Peter has a perfume allergy?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Oh, uh...
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up.
</h1><h1>[Mr. Harrington gets up from his seat as Peter does.] [MJ stands up as Mr. Harrington gives orders.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Ned, take MJ's spot. MJ, you take my spot. [Mr. Harrington turns toward Peter] Peter, let's get you out of there.
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Sorry.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter's seats.
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis</b>: That's all right.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility and Mr. Dell's, but he's... [Mr. Dell can be seen snoring] I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!
</h1><h1>[Peter looks at Mr. Harrington like he's gone bonkers and picks up his bag.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Let's go!
</h1><h1>[Peter moves to his spot.] [Ned Leeds sits down next to Betty Brant, who looks depressed.]
</h1><h1>[Peter passed by Mr. Harrington and sat down at the spot next to him.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle.
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds turns around to Betty Brant.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: So did you want to play <i>Beast Slayer</i>?
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: Nope.
</h1><h1>[Awkward silence.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Have you ever played any kind of PC game or--?
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: No.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: [Nods] Got it.
</h1><h1>[Peter is in the back with Mr. Harrington, looking upset as the teacher is telling a story.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Did I ever tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out?
</h1><h1>[Peter doesn't answer.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her and everything. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video?
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis</b>: Well, I've gotta dual headphone adapter if you wanna watch a movie.
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Only if it's depressing, or hilarious.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: [To Peter] Oh you have a dual headphone adapter. We can watch together.
</h1><h1><b>Pilot</b>: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. Flight time today will be eight hours and forty-nine minutes to Venice, Italy.
</h1><h1>[AIRPORT - VENICE, ITALY]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Hey, man. Did you see Brad and MJ on the plane? They were watching movies and laughing the entire time.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Dude, don’t worry, okay? I’m sure it’s nothing.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: Hey, babe, can you hold this for me, please?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Yeah, of course
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: Thanks
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: What was that?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Well, we actually got to talking on the plane, and it turns out we have a lot in common. So, uh, we’re boyfriend-girlfriend now.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Peter... those were the words of a boy. That boy met a woman. A very strong and powerful woman. And now, that boy’s a man.
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: Babe?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds</b>: Coming, babe.
</h1><h1>[Through customs, Peter is taken away from the group into a private searching area. A stern-looking woman places the case on a table, and unzips it.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: There’s nothing in there, I swear
</h1><h1>[The case is opened and reveals — Peter’s Spider-Man suit. There’s a yellow sticky-note taped to it saying “You almost forgot this — May xx”. The woman picks up the banana placed next to it.]
</h1><h1><b>Attendant</b>: This, no. [holds up banana]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Sorry.
</h1><h1>[Peter has now rushed back to the school group.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: I’m here! Mr. Harrington! I'm here, I'm here!
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Wait, wait, wait, Peter’s here. Thank goodness.
</h1><h1>[The school group took a boat through the Grand Canale in Venice. They group is touristy, taking photos and videos of Venice.]
</h1><h1>[Their boat pulls up to the most dingy-looking hotel in the area. With scaffolding covering the front, the ‘hotel’ sign hanging ’by a thread’.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: Looks like we’re here. They're doing some renovations to the place. Getting some upgrades. 
</h1><h1><b>Student</b>: This place is trash
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington</b>: That must be the concierge.
</h1><h1>[INSIDE HOTEL]
</h1><h1><b>Mr.  Harrington</b>: Everyone, here we are! [He takes in the desolate insides of the hotel — it’s just as bad as the outside, maybe even worse. A cat standing on a table meows. Mr. Harrington steps into a puddle of water] 
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell: </b>Oh whoa... whoa, whoa.
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Tell me we’re not staying here.
</h1><h1><b>Flash Thompson</b>: This place is sinking.
</h1><h1><b>Mr Harrington</b>: [with feigned enthusiasm] I think you mean charming!
</h1><h1><b>Mr Dell</b>: Okay everybody. Drop your bags off and we’re gonna meet at the Da Vinci museum at 3. Let's go!
</h1><h1><b>Me Harrington</b>: Vamanos!
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: It’s andiamo.
</h1><h1><b>Mr Harrington</b>: Andiamo!
</h1><h1><b>Mr Dell</b> [to the students]: When in Rome, you do as Romans do. When you’re in Venice, your socks get wet!
</h1><h1>[Students grumbling]
</h1><h1>[Students are now at the Saint Marco Polo’s Square.]
</h1><h1><b>Flash Thompson</b>: What’s up, Flash Mob, how are you guys doing? I’m in Saint Marco Polo’s [Someone — probably a student — runs past and hits Flash in the groin. Flash doubles over.] — Oh!
</h1><h1>[Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are getting a caricature drawing done of them.]
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant</b>: This is so much fun!
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds:</b> Yeah? [chuckles awkwardly]
</h1><h1>[Mr. Harrison is trying to take a photo of himself in front of the scenery. He sets his camera on the railing and posed awkwardly. The camera beeps and takes the picture. 
Grabbing the camera, Mr. Harrison nearly drops it. 
He looks at the picture and the camera slips from his hands, falling into the water.]
</h1><h1>[Students are taking a photo in front of a touristy thing]
</h1><h1><b>Student</b>: Three, two, one, say ‘pizza!’
</h1><h1><b>Other students</b>: Pizza!
</h1><h1>[MJ is standing with her arms out, pigeons perched on her arm and shoulder while Brad takes her picture.]
</h1><h1>[Away from the crowd, Peter enters a small shop.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Buongiorno.
</h1><h1><b>Shopkeeper</b>: Buongiorno.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Hi, Uh, I’m looking for a, uh...
</h1><h1>~CUT TO THE NECKLACE BEING COMPLETED~
</h1><h1><b>Shopkeeper</b>: Fiore Nero [he holds the black dahlia necklace up to the light]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: It’s perfect.
</h1><h1>[Peter has exited the shop and joined the fray of tourists and locals in Venice. He’s smiling to himself as he holds the bag. MJ comes up unexpectedly behind him.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Boh!
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: What?
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Boh. It’s the most perfect word in the world. Italians crated it, and I just discovered it.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: What does it mean?
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: That’s the thing, it can mean a million things. It can mean ‘I don’t know’, ‘get out of my face’, ‘I don’t know and get out of my face’. It’s the best thing Italy ever created, except for maybe espresso.
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Oh, so you’ve been drinking espresso.
</h1><h1>[An Italian man comes up to them, holding a rose, gesturing between the pair.]
</h1><h1><b>Man</b>: German? American?
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Boh
</h1><h1>[The man frowns and walks off.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Whoa.
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Boh is my new superpower. It’s like the anti aloha. I was born to say this word... So, what’s in the bag?
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: Oh, uh.... Boh.
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Nice.
</h1><h1>[MJ notices the many crabs escaping the water by drawing up the pillars at one of the many docks. She pulls out her phone to take a picture.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ</b>: Whoa, cool.
</h1><h1>[Peter notices the water being sucked into a grate.]
</h1><h1>[Waves rock the boat where Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are comparing hands and smiling at each other.]
</h1><h1><b>Betty</b>: What was that?
</h1><h1>[The waves continue before the water becomes still for a split second. Water erupts from the canal and people scream.]
</h1><h1>[Ned and Betty scream as their boat is pushed towards shore by the waves.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Betty! You okay?
</h1><h1>[Peter helps Betty Brant and Ned Leeds out of the boat.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Come on!
</h1><h1><b>Betty Brant:</b> Guys, we gotta go!
</h1><h1>[The water swirls into the air, forming the shape of a huge man. The colossal water monster roars.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds:</b> What is that?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I don’t know.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds:</b> What’re you gonna do?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I left my suit in the hotel room.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds:</b> Why?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Because I’m on vacation, Ned! Everyone’s gonna see my face, just get them outta here!
</h1><h1>[Peter pushes Ned Leeds towards the stairs where Betty Brant and MJ are waiting. The water monster smashes its hand into a building. More people scream. The creature continues to smash buildings and boats. Peter helps people off the stairs.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Get out of here. Go!
</h1><h1>[Peter turns back to the monster as it crashes into a building in front of him. Peter stumbles back.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Oh, my God!
</h1><h1>[Peter runs up the stairs and barely makes it around the corner before the monster smashes into the building where he had been standing.]
</h1><h1>[More people are screaming and running away.]
</h1><h1>[Peter hits his wrist together to activate his web-shooters.{
</h1><h1><b>Peter </b>[whispers]: Come on.
</h1><h1>[Peter moves around the corner and shoots a web at the monster. The web does nothing because the monster is made out of water. Peter looks mildly exasperated.]
</h1><h1>[People screaming]
</h1><h1>[Peter turns to see the monster heading towards a bridge swarming with people.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b> <b</b>: Oh no, you don’t!
</b<><h1>[Peter jumps across poles in the water and launches himself up onto the bridge by leaping off a peddle. He helps a man up.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> You okay? Get out of here. Go!
</h1><h1>[The water monster slams it’s fist into the bridge and Peter is sent flying backward.] [Peter hits the other side of the bridge, now soaking wet. He coughs up water, panting to catch his breath.]
</h1><h1>[A green light is seen shooting at the monster from above. Behind Peter, there is a rumbling sound and a cloud of green mist appears in the sky. Out of the mist, a man with an elaborate suit with a cape appears, wearing a glass bowl over his head that swirls with mist.]

</h1><h1>[The mysterious man shoots green light at the monster, dodging its attacks as he flies through the air.]
</h1><h1>[The man is thrown onto the ground and the monster roars.]
</h1><h1>[The man emerges from the water and flies at the monster once again.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Excuse me sir! I c- I can help! Let me help! I’m really strong and I’m...sticky!
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio:</b> I need you to lead it away from the canals!
</h1><h1>[The man flies off as the monster smashes into the building where Peter stands. Peter flips away, landing on a nearby roof.]
</h1><h1>[The monster smashes through a building.]

</h1><h1>~CUT TO THE TWO TEACHERS LEADING A SMALL GROUP OF STUDENTS~
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> The DaVinci Museum. This is why we’re here in Venice.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> Oh, this is it. It’s closed.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> What do you mean it’s closed? ‘Till when?
</h1><h1>[Brad and another student stand in front of the museum.]
</h1><h1><b>Student:</b> November.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> [to Mr. Harrington] You didn’t check the website?
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> Oh, that’s a good idea.
</h1><h1>[Mysterio followed by a blast of water, shoot behind them and the group runs.]
</h1><h1>~CUT TO PETER ON THE ROOF~
</h1><h1>Peter sees that the bell tower is about to fall on a bunch of people.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Oh, come on!
</h1><h1>[Peter swings towards the tower.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> [leading a group of students] Stay low, kids. We’ll be safe here.
</h1><h1>[Peter is swinging around the bell tower, using webs to stick it back together. He lands in the top of the bell tower, ducking under the bell to get to the other side.]
</h1><h1>[Peter takes off his mask, watching Mysterio fight the monster.]
</h1><h1>[The bell tower starts to fall again.]
</h1><h1>[Peter shoot a web, attaching it to two buildings across from him.]
</h1><h1>The[ monster hits the tower again.]
</h1><h1>[Peter falls, his head hitting the bell, making it ring.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> [Groans]
</h1><h1>[The tower cracks again, pulling Peter by his webs across it. Peter’s head hits the bell again.]
</h1><h1>[The webs fall from the tower.]
</h1><h1>[Peter shoots new webs, trying to hold the tower up.]
</h1><h1>[Mysterio is still fighting the monster.]
</h1><h1>~CUT TO GROUP OF STUDENTS WATCHING MYSTERIO~
</h1><h1><b>Student:</b> Who is that guy?
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis:</b> I don’t know, but he’s kicking that water’s ass!
</h1><h1>[Mysterio defeats the water monster.]
</h1><h1>[Peter is still trying to keep the bell tower from falling. He yells out as the tower crumbles. His webs break and the tower finally crashes to the ground.]
</h1><h1>[Mysterio lands and people begin cheering.]
</h1><h1>[Peter gets up, checking the black dahlia necklace to make sure it’s not broken. He sighs in relief when he sees that it’s intact.]
</h1><h1>[Mysterio salutes the crowd as they cheer for him before taking off and flying away in a cloud of green smoke.]
</h1><h1>~CUT TO HOTEL~
</h1><h1>[A handful of students are watching a television news report about Mysterio.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds:</b> It’s aliens. It has to be.
</h1><h1><b>Flash:</b> Buzzfeed says there’s a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the internet.
</h1><h1><b>Flash:</b> Spider-Man could take him
</h1><h1><b>Mr Harrington:</b> What do you think it is?
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> You Know, being a man of science.... witches
</h1><h1><b>Peter </b>(on his phone away from the cluster of students): No, no, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May</b> (at office back in New York): It’s a good thing I packed your suit, huh. I can’t believe you forgot it.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> So, who was that guy you were with? Was that Mister Strange?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, ummm... No. I don’t know who that was. He was a new guy. I was trying to help him, but...
</h1><h1>(Peter is cut off by May on the other end of the phone)
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> Hey, Happy. No. That’s my lunch. Don’t eat that one.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Happy’s there?
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> Yeah. It’s Happy. He’s here. He came by to volunteer. And, he’s hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi.
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> No, I don’t...[May forces the phone into his hand] Hi, Peter
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Hey, Happy...
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> I’m sorry. I’m working real hard here. I gotta do a leaflet drop. 
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> What're you doing...
</h1><h1><b>Happy:</b> I’m glad you’re having a good time. Don’t worry. I’m really taking care of your aunt.
</h1><h1>Aunt May retracts the phone from Happy’s ear and focuses back on Peter.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> So, uhh, how’s the plan going?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> There’s... some setbacks, for sure.
</h1><h1><b>Aunt May:</b> Don’t ever think it, just trust your instincts and you’ll be fine.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I know. Love you. Bye.
</h1><h1><b>Betty:</b> Who is that guy?
</h1><h1><b>Brad:</b> He’s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.
</h1><h1><b>Flash:</b> (scoffs) He’s all right. He’s no Spider-Man.
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> What is it with you and Spider-Man?
</h1><h1><b>Flash:</b> What? He’s just awesome, okay? He protects the neighbourhood, and you know, he’s inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man.
</h1><h1>At this point, Peter renters the cluster of students.
</h1><h1><b>Flash:</b> [toward Peter] ’Sup dickwad? I thought you drowned.
</h1><h1>(woman on television speaking Italian)
</h1><h1><b>Brad:</b> Sounds like his name’s Mysterio.
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> L’uomo del misterio is Italian for man of mystery. They don’t actually know who he is.
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Mysterio...
</h1><h1><b>Betty and Ned:</b> Cool name
</h1><h1><b>Betty And Ned:</b> Babe!
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (to MJ) So, how much did you actually see?
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> Not much... I was running.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Right. me too. I was also running...away.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> So, Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna to create an army of the insane.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>oh...
</h1><h1><b>MJ:</b> Which is why it’s my favorite destination on the whole trip.
</h1><h1>~NED AND PETER’S SHARED HOTEL ROOM~
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> What are you gonna do about the water monster?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Nothing. it’s dead. And besides, that Mysterio guy’s all over it. Look... I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris and... I think she really likes me.
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> That’s nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my first fruit cobbler, right-?
</h1><h1>[Ned is hit with a dart in the neck by Nick Fury - who sits in a shaded corner of the room in a chair.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> You’re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> You’re Nick Fury. You just shot Ned.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> It’s just a mild tranquilizer. He’ll be alright. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn’t think that was a good time to exchange numbers.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> No, that would have been really inappropriate
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> That’s what I just said.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Right.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> The important thing is, you’re here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now, you’re here. What a coincidence.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Wait. Was this a coincidence?
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> I used to know everything. Then, I come back five years later and now, I know nothing. No intel, no team, and a high school kid is dodging my calls.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> Here’s what I do know... a week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face. 
</h1><h1>(Ned snores loudly)
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was-
</h1><h1>(a knock on the door cuts Fury off)
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any emotional counseling after today’s traumatic event.
</h1><h1>Fury points his gun towards the door, hidden behind the wall so Mr. Harrington can't see him.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> No. we‘re... we’re okay. We’re fine, thank you.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> Great. Cause I’m not qualified to actually... 
</h1><h1>(Ned snores)
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> Oh, he’s passed out. I’m not really qualified to do it anyway, so... good night.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> That was my teacher, sorry about that. You were saying?
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening...
</h1><h1>(Fury is cut off again by another knock)
</h1><h1><b>Betty:</b> Babe? You still awake? You’re not answering any of my texts.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Um... he’s asleep, Betty.
</h1><h1><b>Betty:</b> Oh, already?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Mh-hmm. Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Betty:</b> Okay
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> That’s why it’s imperative--
</h1><h1>(Once more, another knock stops Fury.)
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> Hey, boys! So, that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria...
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> (annoyed) Another person touches that door, you and I are going to attend another funeral. Suit up.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell (in the backgrounds, still talking):</b> ...let me know if either of you develop vomiting--
</h1><h1>[Fury and Peter (who is in his Spider-Suit) are now seen on a boat]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> left these for you. (He hands Peter a small case)
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Really?
</h1><h1>[Peter opens the case to reveal a pair of glasses. The velvet lining of the case behind the glasses says  Industries".]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury:</b> "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown." (He looks at Peter) said you wouldn't get that because it's not a <i>Star Wars</i> reference. (He scoffs)
</h1><h1>[Cut to Peter and Fury walking into an underground base.]
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> (to Peter) You can lose the mask. Everyone here's seen you without it. You'd only be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason.
</h1><h1>[Peter pulls off his mask, taking in a deep breath.]
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Come on.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (quietly) Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Over there we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri. 
</h1><h1>(Dimitri cocks his gun)
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> And this is Mr. Beck.
</h1><h1>[A man wearing a cape turns around. We recognize his outfit as that of Mysterio.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Mysterio?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> What?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> Well, you can call me Quentin. (He holds out his hand for Peter to shake)
</h1><h1>(Peter shakes his hand)
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (softly) Thanks. I'm sorry. Your world?
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> There are multiple realities, Peter. This is Earth, Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (excitedly) I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse? 'Cause I thought that was just theoretical. That completely changes how we understand the initial singularity. We're talking about an internal inflation system and how does that even work with all the quantum--? It's insane--
</h1><h1>(Peter realizes everyone has turned to look at him, unamused)
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> S-sorry. It's really cool. (he turns back to Beck)
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.
</h1><h1>(Peter smiles)
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> Anyway... 
</h1><h1>A hologram appears on the table.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements: Air, water, fire, earth. The Science Division had a technical name. We just called them Elementals. 
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> Versions of them exist across our mythologies.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> Turns out, the myths are real.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Like Thor. Thor was a myth and now I study him in my physics class.
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> These myths are threats.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> They first materialized on my earth many years ago. We mobilized and fought them, but with each battle they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable. 
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it. 
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three. There's only one left: fire.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It's the one that took my family.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I'm sorry.
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.
</h1><h1><b>Fury: </b>We have one mission: kill it. (to Peter) And you're coming with us.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I'm sorry. Did you say Prague? (laughs nervously) Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kinda stuff. And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir. 
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Bitch, please. You've been to space.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I know, but that was an accident. Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use. What about Thor? 
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Off-world.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Okay, um, Doctor Strange.
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> Unavailable.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Captain Marvel.
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Don't invoke her name.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Sir, look, I really wanna help, I do. But if my aunt finds out that I left my class trip, she's gonna kill me. And if I'm seen like this in Europe, after the Washington Monument, my whole class will figure out who I am and then-- and then the whole world will figure out who I am, then I'm done.
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Okay. I understand.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I'm sorry, what?
</h1><h1><b>Fury:</b> Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious. Dimitri. Take him back to hotel, please.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Thank you, Mr. Fury. And, uh, good luck.
</h1><h1><b>Beck:</b> See ya, kid.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Yeah, see you. (to Agent Hill) Bye, ma'am.
</h1><h1><b>Agent Hill:</b> Yeah.
</h1><h1>~CUT TO OUTSIDE THE HOTEL THE NEXT DAY~
</h1><h1><b>Betty:</b> (talking to Ned) Okay, drink lots of water and I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, okay?
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Okay. Thanks baby.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (exiting hotel) Hey, man. Are you sure you're good?
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Oh, dude, I'm fine.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Okay.
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Seriously, getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me anyway.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> It is pretty awesome.
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Yeah.
</h1><h1>They do a secret handshake.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.
</h1><h1><b>Ned: </b>Seriously.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrison:</b> (exiting the hotel) Good news! We're going to Prague! Huh!
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> What?
</h1><h1><b>Students:</b> Prague?
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrison:</b> Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us. You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying. 
</h1><h1>~CUT TO STUDENTS ROUNDING CORNER OF BUILDING~
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrison:</b> Look at our upgraded ride!
</h1><h1><b>Ned: </b>Peter, wha-- What's going on?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b> I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation.
</h1><h1>The camera cuts to a large black bus. Dimitri is standing beside it with a sign that says "Midtown High".
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington:</b> (holding out his hand to Dimitri) I'm uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh... (Dimitri doesn't respond) Okay.
</h1><h1>They board the bus.
</h1><h1><b>Ned:</b> Awesome.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (unenthusiastically) Yeah. Awesome.

</h1><h1>(A shot of Peter's phone shows him reading an article titled <i>Top 10 Romantic Places in Prague</i>)
</h1><h1>Peter catches sight of the glasses case Fury had given him. He pulls it from his bag and opens it, putting on the Tony-style glasses. He pulls out a note, reading it.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (reading aloud) "For the next Tony, I trust you. (P.S.) say "Edith" (-T.S.)
</h1><h1>The glasses light up.
</h1><h1><b>EDITH:</b> Stand by for retinal and biometric scan. (a scan of Peter's face appears) Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Hello?
</h1><h1><b>EDITH:</b> Hello, Peter. I am EDITH, Tony's augmented-reality security and defense system.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Huh. So, he made you for me?
</h1><h1><b>EDITH:</b> No. But you have access to all of Tony's protocols.
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Cool.
</h1><h1><b>EDITH</b>: would you like to see what I can do? EDITH stands for “Even dead, I’m the hero.” Tony loves his acronyms. 
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: [chuckles] Yeah, he did. 
</h1><h1><b>EDITH:</b> I have access to the entire Global Security network including multiple defense satellites as well as back does to all major telecommunication networks.

</h1><h1><b>Female Agent:</b> [not shaking his hand] Take off your clothes. 
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> (looking uncomfortable) Excuse me?
</h1><h1><b>Female Agent:</b> You told Fury Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe. So I made you this [she grabs a black folded suit from her bag] another suit. 
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Oh, uh, thank you. [he takes the suit] I’m sure it fits fine I don’t need to try–

</h1><h1><b>Brad:</b> Sorry? Uh, I thought this was the bathroom.

</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> No, that’s not what that was. Honestly. 
</h1><h1><b>Brad:</b> I can’t pretend I didn’t see what I just saw. I know you’re trying to get with MJ. It’s obvious. But I like her too.

</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yes, sir?
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>That thing's going to be here in a few hours. Are we boring you?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>He's not bored, he's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>He had obstacles. I removed them.
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>They still won't evacuate the city.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>(groans) Idiots. So what's the plan,?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I will be in the cathedral tower keeping watch for the fire monster. When that shows up, I will radio you guys, and then Mr. Beck and I will-
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>My name is Mysterio.
</h1><h1>[Quentin shoots Peter a playful look. Peter chuckles under his breath.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>That's when Mysterio and I will move in.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Peter, listen to me. The best hope you have -- the only hope -- is to stop it here and now, no matter what the cost. Keep it away from civilians if you can, but, most important, keep it away from metal. If it gets too big, it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core. After that, there's no way to stop it.
</h1><h1>[Peter briefly shares a glance with Fury.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Hey, man, my friends are here? And I can't help but think we're putting them in danger-
</h1><h1>[Fury stands up and walks over to Peter.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>You're worried about <i>us</i> hurting your friends? You? Who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus? gave you a multi-billion dollar AR tactical intelligence system, and the first thing you do with it? Is try and blow up your friends. It's clear to me that you were not ready for this!
</h1><h1>[We cut to Peter, sitting alone on a rooftop. Mysterio flies up towards him with his helmet on]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Look, Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing. He just, he felt bad about snapping at you.

</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You guys do have sarcasm on this earth, right? 
</h1><h1>[Beck sits down, right next to Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>How you feelin'?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just... I had this plan with this girl that I really like, and...now it's all ruined.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(sympathetically) You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It's a hard path. You see things, you do things... Make choices. People look up to you... Even if you win a battle sometimes, they die. I like you, Peter. You're a good kid. There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just... turn around, run away from all this. And then, there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight. What's at stake. And I'm glad you're here.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Me, too. (worried tone) But...
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(friendly) You're worried about your friends.

</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>But not the last threat we'll ever face. We need to stay vigilant. There's a void in this world for someone like you. Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow. You should join us.
</h1><h1>[Quentin stands, clasping Fury's hand.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Thank you. I just might take you up on that.
</h1><h1>[Fury turns to where Peter stands still as a statue and walks over. Beck sits back down.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>You got gifts,. But you didn't wanna be here.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Mr. Fury, I--
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>I'd love to have you in Berlin, too. But you've got to decide whether you're going to step up or not. chose you. He made you an Avenger. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe was wrong. Was he?
</h1><h1>[Peter begins to tear up.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>The choice is yours.
</h1><h1>[Fury walks away from Peter, who casts his eyes down in shame. Beck stands and walks over to Peter, placing a hand on his shoulder.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Let's get a drink.
</h1><h1>[Quentin walks offscreen and Peter turns to look at him.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm not twenty-one...
</h1><h1>[Cut to the inside of a packed bar. Quentin holds a bottle of beer in his hand and Peter looks down, dejected, at his glass.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Hey.
</h1><h1>[Quentin pats Peter on the shoulder.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You gotta celebrate, you did something good tonight.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah...
</h1><h1>[Quentin pats him on the back.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Fury was right. Tony did a lot for me, so... I owe it to him, to everybody.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Do you?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah! I mean...  Mr. gave me the chance to be more, he wanted me to be better than him, and Fury just wants me to live up to that.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> What do YOU want, Peter?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> What do you mean?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> What do you want?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> …uh, I don’t… know…
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> What do you want, you, Peter, right now? I know you’re thinking about it! What do-
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> I wanna go on my trip Right? I wanna go back on my trip, with my friends. I wanna go to the top of the Eiffel Tower with the girl who I like and tell her how I really feel, and… give her a kiss! I don’t…
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> Ooh!
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Shut up, man! I...
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>But you're not gonna do that, are you?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> No, I can't!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Why not?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Because I have too much of a responsibility!
</h1><h1>[A local picks up the E.D.I.T.H. glasses and hands them to Peter.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Oh, my God, thank you so much!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>What are those? Are those the...?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> E.D.I.T.H. glasses, yeah!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>It was on the floor? Try them on, let's see how they look on you.
</h1><h1>[Peter puts on the glasses and looks at Quentin.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> ...I actually really like them!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Can I be completely honest with you?
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> Please.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>They look really stupid.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Oh.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>But maybe they have a contact-lens version of them.
</h1><h1>[Peter takes off the glasses.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>You try 'em on.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>No, c'mon!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Try 'em on!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>I don't wanna- I don't wanna try 'em on!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Just put 'em on!
</h1><h1>[Beck takes the glasses from Peter and puts them on.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>What do you think, kid?
</h1><h1>[Peter stares at Quentin for a long time, then breaks eye contact.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(to himself) "To the next Tony, I trust you..." "To the next Tony, I trust you."
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>What?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Mr. left me a message with those glasses; "To the next Tony, I trust you."
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>He knew every mistake I ever made, okay? So he must've known I was not ready for something like this.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Why would he give it to you?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Because maybe he didn't trust me to have E.D.I.T.H., he just trusted me to pick who should. It makes so much more sense, he always knew I would do what's right and he's not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would just give himself E.D.I.T.H.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Alright, you're probably right about that.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Right, so, the world needs the next Iron Man... and it's not gonna be me! I mean, I'm a sixteen-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult with some experience and that's good like Tony, like you.
</h1><h1>[Quentin looks at Peter for a moment and takes the glasses off.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> No, c'mon, Peter... No.
</h1><h1>[Peter takes the glasses and puts them on.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>E.D.I.T.H.?
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Hello, Peter.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Hi! Yeah, um... I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Peter, what are you doing?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm doing the right thing.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Any transfer will require confirmation.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> gave <i>you </i>the glasses!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b gave me a choice! It's my choice to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it. Look, you're a soldier, a leader, you stopped the Elementals, you saved my life, you saved the world! Okay? He'd want you to have them.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.:</b> Waiting for confirmation.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Confirm.
</h1><h1>[Peter takes off the glasses and holds them out to Quentin.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Welcome to the Avengers.
</h1><h1>[Quentin puts the glasses on as a few notes of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme play in the background. The two shake hands.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck:</b> Thank you. It's an honor.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1>[Peter slings his backpack over his shoulder, standing up to leave.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Mr. would've really liked you.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Where you headed?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm gonna go find MJ.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance, you're pretty awkward, so...
</h1><h1>[Peter laughs.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah. See ya later, man!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>See ya!
</h1><h1>[Just as Peter has left the bar, several things start to gradually disappear, both objects and people are revealed to be holograms. Quentin, sitting in the middle of the illusion, starts to smile]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>See? That wasn't so hard.
</h1><h1>[The people that haven't vanished, erupt in applause and cheers]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(overjoyed) Somebody get this stupid costume off me!
</h1><h1>[Outside, Peter walks past a memorial for Tony, smiling and convinced he has done the right thing. In the "bar", Quentin, now without his superhero clothes, hands the glasses to one of his associates]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Okay, we got EDITH. Get these connected to our system.
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(trying to calm them) Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
</h1><h1>[It's clear that there's no chance to stop the victory whirl, so Quentin steps on the counter]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Okay, toasts! Give me that, Doug! (grabs a bottle of champagne) To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony.
</h1><h1>[He lifts the bottle in the air]
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>Boo!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>The jester king. Literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield. Like the holographic system I designed. A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...
</h1><h1>[Brief flashback of Tony in Captain America: Civil War, where Tony presents his final meeting with his parents, using the same holographic technology]
</h1><h1><b>Tony: </b>Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF...
</h1><h1>[The crowd laughs while the hologram disappears and Tony takes off his glasses]
</h1><h1><b>Tony: </b>Oh, $611,000,000 for my little therapeutic experiment...?
</h1><h1>[Zoom in, Quentin Beck is standing behind Tony, with a disgusted grimace on his face]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b>He renamed my life's work BARF.
</h1><h1>[Back to the present]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>I told him that it was a mistake. That my technology can change the world. And then... He fired me. Said I was... unstable. (determined) To Tony!
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>(all holding champagne) To Tony!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Next, to William.
</h1><h1>[We get a brief flashback to the movie that started it all, Iron Man, where Obediah Stane yells at one of his employees, William Ginther Riva]
</h1><h1><b>Obediah Stane: </b>(yelling, pointing at William) Tony was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
</h1><h1>[Brief zoom in, a wipe brings us back to the current William]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>The integration of my illusion tech, with your weaponized drones, was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it's just the beginning.
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>(proud) Thank you, brother.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>To Guterman.
</h1><h1>[Cut to another man, Quentin Beck's story writer and acting coach]
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>To Guterman!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>The story you created of a soldier from another earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous! And apparently exactly the kind of thing people will believe right now! I mean, everybody bought it!
</h1><h1>[More cheers from the group]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>To Victoria.
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>To Victoria!
</h1><h1>[Cut to a woman in her late twenties, early thirties]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies? Inspired idea. To Janice!
</h1><h1>[Cut to another woman]
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>Janice!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that EDITH was being handed over -- not to us, not to the Defense Department, but to a child.
</h1><h1><b>Janice: </b>Thank you!
</h1><h1><b>Man: </b>(among the cheers) To Janice!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>And to the rest of you, Tony is gone. There is a window of opportunity and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you're flying around with a cape, or shooting lasers from your hands, no one will even listen. Well... I've got a cape. And lasers. (soft laughter) With our technology, and with EDITH, Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth! (more cheers) And everyone will listen! Not to a boozy man-child!
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>No!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Not to a hormonal teenager!
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>No!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>To me! And to my very wealthy crew! To us.
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>To us!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(lifting the bottle) To Mysterio!
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>To Mysterio!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>To Peter.
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio's Crew: </b>To Peter!
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(a bit of guilt) Poor kid. (back to business) Let's get to work.
</h1><h1>---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. :) - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I am Spider-Man. And I messed up so bad.
</h1><h1>----------------
</h1><h1>[We see Mysterio flying around some kind of a storm Elemental, firing lasers at it]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b>You took everything from me! This is for my family!
</h1><h1>[The camera pans down, several people of Mysterio's crew admire or inspect the scene, while William is looking on his phone.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Pause. Pause?
</h1><h1>[We see Quentin Beck standing in the middle of the room, which looks suspiciously like a movie studio. He wears a motion capture outfit]
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>(looking up) Sorry.
</h1><h1>[William pauses the illusion]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yeah, uh, can you just fast-forward to the end?
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Yeah. Standby.
</h1><h1>[The visual flashes forward to the climax]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(mumbling to himself) Right. Fly, fly, fly... Zap, zap, zap... Pause.
</h1><h1>[The Elemental freezes again]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>I'm not in love with this choreography, but it'll do. Kill image.
</h1><h1>[The illusion disappears]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Decloak drones.
</h1><h1>[Where the Elemental used to be, several drones appear out of thin air when their cloaking devices are deactivated]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Right, weapons?
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>You wanna weaponize them?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yup.
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Weapons only. Standby.
</h1><h1>[Several drones fly towards some prop pillars in the lot, firing at them as they fly by.]
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Nice.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Stop. Something... I don't know what it is. It's something... Just dou... You know what? Double the damage, and then run it again.
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>You want me to double it up?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Alright. Cover your ears.
</h1><h1>[The image of the Elemental appears again. Through the underlying drones, it seems like he punches the pillars to pieces. Shortly thereafter, the holographic Mysterio fires a laser at it and defeats it]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>That's good! That's good.
</h1><h1>[William gives two thumbs up]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>We're on schedule?
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to EDITH network, where drones will be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons hot. We need maximum damage.
</h1><h1><b>Guterman: </b>That's gonna cause a lot of casualties.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Oh, yeah. More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static. London is a beautiful city and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I'm gonna be the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But, when its new savior descends...
</h1><h1>[The holographic projection of Mysterio flies down and incapsulates Beck like a second skin. His voice is slightly altered and amplified]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b>...all those casualties will be forgotten.
</h1><h1>[Mysterio's helmet disappears, Beck directs his attention to Janice, who is working on the real Mysterio suit]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Janice, you'll be in position with a quick change armor, for the victory lap?
</h1><h1><b>Janice: </b>Of course. Do you want to try...
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>No, no. That's...
</h1><h1>[The footage becomes slightly distorted around Beck's waving upper arm]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It's fine.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Wait, and you're... You're telling me this, now?
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>That projector is evidence. It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it. I am trying to fool seven billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet.
</h1><h1>[Beck seems to get more unhinged as he goes on]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>And if he catches on before I've killed him, then he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head! Right?
</h1><h1>[Two drones fly towards Guterman and Victoria]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Right?!
</h1><h1>[Two others fly towards William, aiming at his forehead]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>William, can you look at me?
</h1><h1>[He does]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Pull up EDITH.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b><i>Hello, Quentin.</i>
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yeah. Hi, honey. I need a level 5 search full resource protocol for this device.
</h1><h1>[A map is projected and steadily magnified]
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Magnifying...
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>There. Search everything going in and out of that building.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Located.
</h1><h1>[Through video footage, we see how MJ got the projector, took it to the bridge and showed it to Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Shit. (looking back at William, furious) You know William, one day, after I've had to kill Peter because of this... I hope you remember, that his blood is on <i>your</i> hands!
</h1><h1>[Quentin walks out.]
</h1><h1>[Cut to MJ's hotel room, where Peter frantically closes the window curtains.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses! I mean, how could I be that stupid? He's probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>You had access to killer drones?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah, I didn't really want 'em, especially after I almost killed Brad.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>You almost killed Brad?!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Look, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but... I think he tapped my phone.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Okay, so what are you gonna do?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Well, I need my suit and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.
</h1><h1>[Peter takes his shirt off in front of MJ, then stops to stare at MJ, clearly embarrassed. After a few awkward seconds, MJ gets the message and turns around while Peter strips down to his underwear and begins to put on the stealth suit. MJ still manages to sneak a peek, however, before the camera pans over to reveal Ned standing in the doorway. The two share a glance -- MJ impassive, Ned panicked.]
</h1><h1>[Cut to a wide shot of Peter zipping up the Stealth Suit. He lifts up the eye visors.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Ah! Ned, perfect!
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>The costume looks great! For the costume party, at the... Prince's castle...
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>She knows. I told her.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>He didn't tell me. I figured it out.
</h1><h1>[Ned hesitates, then slowly nods.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Oh. That's cool.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Like, a long time ago.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>...oh.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>But he- But he saved me and Betty's lives...
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>No, he's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Whoa! That's... crazy!
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1>[A beat while Peter and MJ share a glance.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>So, you guys were, like... working the case together, or what?
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>It's been mostly me.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington, say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin until this all blows over, okay?
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>Got it. Easy.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Wow. You guys lie with such ease.
</h1><h1>[Ned shrugs.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: G</b>otta go.
</h1><h1>[Peter starts to move out, pulling open the window curtains.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Wait! Ah, wait, wait, wait! The projector. You're gonna need this.
</h1><h1>[MJ throws Peter the projector, which he catches.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Don't tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger.
</h1><h1>[With that, Peter jumps out the window. MJ stares after him as the camera slowly pans over to Ned.]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>So, you know, too. It's cool! Um. I mean, I've known first and I've known longer but it's not a competition...
</h1><h1>[Cut to a train station where Peter swings onto the top of a moving train as it pulls out of the station. Cut to a wide shot of the city with the <i><a class="text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin">Berliner Fernsehturm</a></i> in the foreground. The text "Berlin, Germany" is superimposed over the landscape.]
</h1><h1>[The train pulls into the station and Peter jumps off, swinging over a crowd before landing in front of a civilian.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Uh, 'scuse me? Do you know where-
</h1><h1><b>Woman: </b>Nacht Monkey!
</h1><h1>[The woman runs away.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, wait, I didn't...! Aw, man!
</h1><h1>[A black Audi pulls up in front of Peter. The window rolls down to reveal Nick Fury.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Get in.
</h1><h1>[Peter does so and the car speeds off. Peter pulls off his mask, breathing heavily.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Mr. Fury!
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>You've got a lot of explaining to do.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, no, no, listen!
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Wait until we're secure.
</h1><h1>[Peter pushes himself back into his seat.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay...
</h1><h1>[Peter takes a few deep breaths until Fury clears his throat. He makes a slashing motion across his chest, indicating for Peter to put his seatbelt on.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Right.
</h1><h1>[Peter tugs on the seatbelt but finds that it's stuck. After a few attempts at loosening it, Peter tugs on the strap so hard that it finally breaks off. Peter nervously looks over to Fury, who gives him a disappointed look and turns his eye back to the road. The car pulls into the garage of a very fancy looking building.]
</h1><h1>[Cut to the inside of a pristine white facility, teeming with staff members who Peter and Fury walk past. S.H.I.E.L.D. has obviously recovered from the events of <i>The Winter Soldier </i>quite well. Peter and Fury enter a conference room where Maria Hill is standing.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>So... Is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend?
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>He's talking about E.D.I.T.H.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Look, I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry, but he is not who you think he is. Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake. He has some sort of illusion tech, and that's how he tricked you guys and he tricked me into giving him E.D.I.T.H.
</h1><h1>[Peter pulls out the projector that MJ recovered and slides it across the table.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>So all that death and destruction we witnessed was caused by <i>this</i>?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, not just this! I think he's using drones.
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this?
</h1><h1>[Peter then senses something]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b?!
</b><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>What's wrong?
</b><h1><b>Peter: </b>It's Beck. He's here.
</h1><h1>[He puts his eyepiece back when the hologram starts to disappear, Maria Hill included. The facility is just an abandoned building.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>(shocked) What? Hill?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, it's just an ill...
</h1><h1>[A missile is fired from behind Peter, seemingly hitting and killing Fury]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Fury!
</h1><h1>[He looks back and sees one of the weaponized drones. It takes another shot, blasting Peter through the back wall, causing him to fall several floors down. Quentin Beck's voice, amplified, takes center stage. Peter gets surrounded by drones, all pointing lasers at him]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>Wow, Peter. Wow. I thought we were close. Fury always had to die. But not you.</i>
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Stop hiding, Beck!
</h1><h1>[Peter shoots some web at one of the drones but misses. Their cloaking devices activate and they disappear, while another illusion gets activated]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>I tried to help you walk away. Now you're making me do this… do this… do this…</i>
</h1><h1>[Everything goes dark. Peter, now in his original Tony suit, looks in horror when lights fall down, revealing a school corridor covered in green smoke. Mysterio walks towards him]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You told me, you were just a kid.
</h1><h1>[Peter shoots his web, but only green smoke sprays out of his hands. Mysterio is then suddenly behind him]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You told me...
</h1><h1>[Peter punches him, only to reveal it's a brick pillar]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>...you wanted to run after that girl.</i>
</h1><h1><b>MJ (vo): </b>Help me!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>MJ!
</h1><h1>[He runs through a door when he's suddenly on top of the Eiffel Tower. The door breaks loose and falls down. Peter looks to his right and sees MJ, confused and scared]
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Peter? What's going on?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I know this isn't real.
</h1><h1>[Mysterio then materializes out of the full moon, grabbing MJ by her neck]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Do you, though?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>MJ!
</h1><h1>[Mysterio throws her away, Peter dives after her]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>MJ!
</h1><h1>[The illusion disappears. Peter hits the floor, MJ's screams still echoing through his head]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter... [Echoing] Peter... Peter...</i>
</h1><h1>[Several buildings pass Peter at incredible speeds. One of the buildings, with a neon sign that says "Queens" above it, stops before him. Mysterio's gigantic fist then punches through it, sending Peter flying. He flies through the horizon, it shatters like glass. After falling through some webs, the illusion is briefly lifted]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>(distorted) You need to WAKE UP!</i>
</h1><h1>[Peter crashes on top of a car. He gets back on the ground, looking around, breathing anxiously. A dozen of drones then fly out of the windows of the building, the illusion continues. Huge shards of glass fall down, surrounding Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>
</h1><h1>[When Peter reaches out to touch one of his reflections, the reflection comes to life, grabbing his hand. Dozens of Spider-Men hurl themselves at Peter, pulling his suit away]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>You are just a scared little kid in a sweatsuit!</i>
</h1><h1>[The Spider-Men vanish, Peter is now in his homemade suit. He stands among the ruins of a Captain America statue, right in the center of the shield.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in.</i>
</h1><h1>[The camera focusses on a colossal Mysterio statue]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>I control the truth!</i> [part of voice lowering down] <i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>
</h1><h1>[Mysterio attacks, firing lasers at Spider-Man. He ducks away and grabs Mysterio with his web. He pulls, only for him to disappear, he had pulled a crane down. He avoids the crane, but not the stone arm that falls on top of him while he screams. Peter then stands by Anthony Edward's grave. Yes, it's Tony's full name.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>If you were good enough,</i> (softer) <i><b>maybe Tony would still be alive.</b></i>
</h1><h1>[A mechanized hand bursts out of the ground, trying to grab Peter, who scurries back in fear. The partially decomposed corpse of Tony in an Iron Man suit crawls out of the grave and hovers up. We zoom in on the eye socket, a black widow spider crawls out of it, the eyes transform in several marching Mysterios]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (echoing): </b>Deep down, you know I'm right.
</h1><h1>[Zoom in on one of the eyes on his costume. It opens and Spider-Man then finds himself in a gigantic snow globe, several buildings shoot out of the snow, surrounding him. We zoom out, the snow globe is Mysterio's head, who detaches it from his body]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck (vo): </b><i>You made your choice, and all you had to do was step aside. And now, you ha-</i>
</h1><h1>[Bang! The illusion suddenly vanishes when Quentin, in his mo-cap outfit, falls on his knees. As he falls to the ground, Fury, who shot Quentin, limps towards Peter, who had been lying in a pile of sand. Several operatives drive onto the scene, get out of their cars and surround Beck]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(crawling out of the sand) Fury!
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Beck's people... We're trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who'd you tell?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Eh...
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>I know you told someone. So, just tell me...
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay...
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>Who did you tell? (raises his voice) Who else did you tell?!
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Just Ned and MJ from my class, and maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.
</h1><h1>[Nick chuckles and shakes his head.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>What?
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>You... are so gullible.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>What?
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>I mean, you're smart as a whip. Just a... [in Quentin's voice] <b> </b>...sucker.
</h1><h1>[The last piece of the illusion is lifted, Nick Fury was Beck the whole time]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>And now all your friends have to die.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Oh, my god!
</h1><h1>[The two drones on Quentin's sides project a stream of illusions to scare Peter away]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves. But for what it's worth, Peter... I really am sorry.
</h1><h1>[The illusion stops. Peter, confused, gets hit by a train, which drives away into a tunnel]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>EDITH?
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Yes, Quentin?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Access files to Peter's class trip. I need them to fly home from London.
</h1><h1>[Peter, dazed and bruised by the impact of the train, climbs on the train's side. He enters it and sits down in one of the seats before he falls unconscious.]
</h1><h1>[Cut to black.]
</h1><h1>[Peter wakes up in a prison cell, an orange football shirt over his chest. He looks to his right to see a Dutch football hooligan]
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #1: </b>Hi.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(confused) Where am I?
</h1><h1>[Another hooligan, sitting to Peter's left, answers]
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #2: </b>Municipal holding facility.
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #1: </b>They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous.
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #3: </b>We gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English.
</h1><h1><b>All Three: </b>Welcome to the Netherlands.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm in the Netherlands right now?
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #1: </b>Yup.
</h1><h1>[Peter stands up and runs to the cell door]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(calling out) Guard?
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #1: </b>The guard's on a break. Probably talking to his wife.
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #2: </b>Yeah. She's pregnant.
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #3: </b>(in Dutch) Oh ja? Wat leuk!
</h1><h1><b>Dutch Football Hooligan #2: </b>(responds in Dutch) Ja, vier weken al.
</h1><h1>[Peter breaks the lock with his hand, opens the door and leaves the cell. One of the hooligans stands up and walks to the open door. Peter looks to his left to see the guard wearing the Night Monkey mask. He is indeed talking over the phone to someone]
</h1><h1><b>Guard: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey. Yeah.
</h1><h1>[Peter leaves the building, the guard directs his attention to the, no longer locked up, hooligans]
</h1><h1><b>Guard: </b>You guys okay?
</h1><h1>[The hooligan closes the door. Peter, now outside on a rather stereotypical farmers market, puts the football shirt on. After stepping in something, he makes his way to a cheese farmer]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Excuse me, sir? Can I borrow your phone?
</h1><h1><b>Cheese Farmer: </b>(in Dutch) Ja, zeker.<b> </b>
</h1><h1>[He hands Peter his phone]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Everyone's so nice here.
</h1><h1>[He thinks about who to call for a bit, before typing in Happy's cell]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay... Pick up, pick up, pick up... Hey. Hey! Uh... I messed up. I need a... I need a ride. Where am I? Uh... where am I, sir?
</h1><h1><b>Cheese Farmer: </b>(in Dutch) Het is Broek op Langedijk.
</h1><h1>[Peter, clearly having difficulty with Dutch pronunciation, asks the cheese farmer for another favor]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Hang on, could you say that into there?
</h1><h1><b>Cheese Farmer: </b>Hi, it's Broek op Langedijk.
</h1><h1>[Title card: Broek op Langedijk, Netherlands]
</h1><h1><b>Cheese Farmer: </b>Yeah, no problem.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Thanks. (over the phone) Did you get that?
</h1><h1>CUT to a tulip field.
</h1><h1>[Peter is walking between rows of tulips, one pink and one yellow. A roaring sound as the Quinjet appears, landing in front of him as he staggers forward. A door opens and Happy walks down the stairs]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Peter? Are you okay?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Happy, is that you?
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Is it me? Yeah, of course, it's me!
</h1><h1>[Peter hesitates, then halts]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Stop! Tell me something only you would know!
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Something only I would know. Uh. You-I-uh, remember when we went to Germany? You pay-for-viewed a video in your room? They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film at the front desk. And you didn't know how I knew-
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay! Okay! Fine, it's you, it's you, stop!
</h1><h1>[They hug]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>It's so good to see you.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Peter, you're going to have to tell me what the hell is going on here.
</h1><h1>[Happy is stitching up wounds in Peter's back, clearly causing pain]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Okay... hold still. Here we go.
</h1><h1>[Peter visibly flinches]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>I thought you had super strength.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>It still hurts.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>All right, relax. Just a few more... there we go.
</h1><h1>[Peter yells in pain and slams his fist on the table.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Relax!
</h1><h1>[Peter jumps up from his chair.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Don't tell me to relax, Happy! how can I relax when I've messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend so I gave him the only thing that Mr. left behind for me and now he's going to kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax.
</h1><h1>[He sits down, silent for a few moments.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't shout. I just really miss him.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Yeah, I miss him too.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Everywhere I go, I see his face. And the whole world is asking who is going to be the next Iron Man and... I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>You're not Iron Man. You're never going to be Iron Man. Nobody can live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did, he was all over the place. The one thing he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would've done what he did... if he didn't know that you were going to be here after he was gone. Your friends are in trouble. You're all alone. The tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it?
</h1><h1>[Peter stands, determined.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>I'm gonna kick his ass.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>No, I mean right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last fifteen minutes.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Right, um... I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones... uh, give me your phone?
</h1><h1>[He walks over to Happy.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>My, my cell phone?
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Okay. Here.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>What's your password?
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Password.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>No, what <i>is </i>your password?
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Password. The word. Spell it out, password.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>You're the head of security and your password is 'password'?
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Yeah, I don't feel good about it either.
</h1><h1>[Peter has pulled up an app where Flash is vlogging.]
</h1><h1><i><b>Flash Thompson, over the phone: </b>Ello, governor! Cup of tea for you? I'mma be in London soon.</i>
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>They're in London.
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>London? Okay.
</h1><h1>[He gets up, moving toward the front of the Quinjet]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah. I need a suit!
</h1><h1>[Happy turns, a bit of a grin on his face.]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Suit?
</h1><h1>[Happy turns again and walks forward, pressing some buttons on the ceiling. The Avengers theme makes a welcome cameo while a compartment opens behind Peter. The two turn and make eye contact, Peter smiling, then he turns back toward the compartment and moves toward it. Another small compartment opens as Peter stares at it. A small metal pad descends from a part of the ceiling, and Peter puts his hand on it. Blue lights appear, and he steps back.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay, um... bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.
</h1><h1>[Holograms appear, and Peter scrolls through them as Happy watches.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Yeah, open that. Okay. No, no, no...
</h1><h1>[He turns around with a holographic web shooter when he notices Happy watching him.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter:</b> What?
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Nothing. You take care of the suit, I take care of the music.
</h1><h1>[Happy presses a few more buttons on the ceiling, the song Back in Black by AC/DC comes on.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter, tossing a wrench in the air: </b>Oh, I love Led Zeppelin! 
</h1><h1>[The plane takes off from the field of tulips, and Peter expands a hologram of the Spider-Man suit.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters? 
</h1><h1>[A hologram of the web-shooter appears, and Peter pulls out a small part.]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Isolate the taser webs and reconfigure and boost the voltage to a factor of... 25 percent. And with complete manual control over detonation.
</h1><h1>[Scene cuts to Nick Fury and Maria Hill walking through the halls of a building.]
</h1><h1><b>Nick</b> <b>Fury: </b>I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information.
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>Nick... satellites are picking up an E.M. pulse.
</h1><h1><b>Nick</b> <b>Fury: </b>I thought that was over.
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>It's the biggest one yet.
</h1><h1><b>Nick</b> <b>Fury: </b>Where?
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>London.
</h1><h1>[Cuts to the Decathlon team, walking through an airport.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington: </b>Okay guys, the company set up a city tour, and then we'll grab a bite, then head to the airport.
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis: </b>Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell:</b> I get it. There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis: </b>No, no, no. I'm talking about Peter. Has no one else here noticed how shady he is? Because I saw him in a bathroom of a rest stop with some woman, in his underwear...
</h1><h1>[Ned and MJ exchange glances.]
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis, continuing: </b>...and he's always sneaking away! Like back at the opera? Huh? And now what, he's suddenly off the trip? With his family in Berlin? Is no one else here interested in the truth?
</h1><h1>[Ned lifts a hand, presumably about to talk, but MJ puts an arm in front of him.]
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world."
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis: </b>George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Yeah, well. I mean, since Peter's not here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?
</h1><h1><b>Flash Thompson, clearly recording it: </b>Yeah, dude. What's that about?
</h1><h1><b>Brad Davis: </b>No, no, it wasn't like that! It was... I was just trying to take...
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington: </b>Let's just put all this craziness behind us, and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. "Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," said the class, okay...
</h1><h1>[They leave, all except for Mr. Dell and Brad.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Dell: </b>I'm gonna be the cool teacher right now... you've got to stop doing that, okay? It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. Okay?
</h1><h1>[Brad, defeated, wipes his nose as Mr. Dell walks away. Cut to the rest of the science team.]
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington: </b>Look at this!
</h1><h1><b>Bus Driver: </b>Mr. Harrington. Come on.
</h1><h1><b>Mr. Harrington: </b>We've got a bus all to ourselves!
</h1><h1><b>Bus Driver: </b>Nice to see you all. Come along.
</h1><h1>[Kids hand the man some backpacks. They go onto the bus. The driver, Guterman, presses a button on an earpiece in his ear.]
</h1><h1><b>Guterman: </b><i>I have the kids.</i>
</h1><h1>[Cut to Mysterio, flying around the city, before hovering outside a window in front of Nick Fury.]
</h1><h1><b>Beck: </b>I got here as fast as I could. I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.
</h1><h1><b>Nick</b> <b>Fury: </b>Damn it.
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>Pulse is spiking.
</h1><h1>[Beck turns to fly off.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>I'll take another look.
</h1><h1><b>Nick</b> <b>Fury: </b>Soon as you see something, report. You're all we got, Beck.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>This is what I fear. May God help us, Fury.
</h1><h1>[Cuts to Beck standing in his mocap suit, two drones hovering at his side.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b><i>God, help us all.</i>
</h1><h1>[A dramatic pause.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go. William, launch the drones.
</h1><h1><b>William Ginther Riva: </b>(behind a computer) Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere, weapons hot.
</h1><h1>[Cuts to a satellite, releasing hundreds of drones.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>Excellent. Janice?
</h1><h1>[Janice is steaming the tangible cape of Quentin]
</h1><h1><b>Janice: </b>Still working on the cape.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>You gotta get those wrinkles out in a few hours. I could literally be shaking hands with the Queen.<b> </b>Guterman?
</h1><h1>[Guterman drives the bus to a specific location]
</h1><h1><b>Guterman: </b>Almost in position.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>Okay, hit it, Victoria.
</h1><h1><b>Victoria: </b>Increasing pulse.
</h1><h1>[Cut to Maria Hill on her computer, watching the pulse.]
</h1><h1><b>Maria Hill: </b>Whatever this thing is, it's a hundred times bigger than the previous ones.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>EDITH?
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Yes, Quentin.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>Show me my loose ends.
</h1><h1>[Holograms showing Nick Fury and Maria Hill show up, then switch to Betty Brant, MJ, and Ned.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck: </b>Once the show's going, execute a kill order on my command.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b>Copy.

</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>William, I've got drones breaking formation.
</h1><h1><b>William: </b>Well, maybe they hit a flock of birds or something. You're fine.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Well, I wanna see what's going on there. I'm taking manual control.
</h1><h1>[From within the massive Elemental illusion, a drone turns around. From his wrist screen, Beck sees Peter webbing up the drones.]
</h1><h1><b>William: </b>(over radio) Do you see anything?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.
</h1><h1>---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. :) - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---

</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>They'll see what I want them to see!
</h1><h1><b>Janice: </b>Do you still need the cape?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Yes, Janice, I still need the cape.
</h1><h1>[William clicks a button on his keyboard.]
</h1><h1><b>William: </b>Done.
</h1><h1>[At the London Bridge, the illusion of Mysterio and the mega Elemental disappear.]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>Now, William? Render my illusion suit.
</h1><h1><b>William: </b>Alright, hang on!

</h1><h1>[Spider-Man has Beck right where he wants him, holding him in the air by the broken helmet]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Your lies are over, Beck.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(not worried) This certainly isn't ideal, but... I have contingencies. EDITH?
</h1><h1>[A drone shoots Peter to the other end of the corridor. Beck lands on his feet]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(getting back up) Just give me the glasses.
</h1><h1>[Beck pulls E.D.I.T.H. out of his motion-capture suit]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>You want these? Come and get them.
</h1><h1>[The drones activate their cloaking mechanism and the projection system. The corridor turns dack and green mist flows over the floor]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(taking a deep breath) Come on, Peter-tingle.
</h1><h1>[He closes his eyes and goes for it. He jumps all across the corridor, destroying drone after drone and coming closer and closer to the villain]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(while pressing buttons) Why aren't these drones firing?
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b><i>You're in the strike zone. The chance of getting hit...</i>
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(losing it) No, FIRE... ALL THE DRONES... NOOOOOOOOOW!
</h1><h1>[The drones behind him flies forward and activate their weapons. Peter knocks his way through them. During the fight, one of the drones is spinned around and Beck is hit in the chest by a rogue bullet. After all the drones are destroyed, Peter steps towards her former friend, taking off his mask]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Beck! Beck... You lied to me. I trusted you.
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>I know. That's the most... disappointing part. You're a good person, Peter. Such a weakness...
</h1><h1>[Quentin takes the glasses and hands them towards Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b was right. You do deserve that.
</h1><h1>[Peter grabs something to his right. BANG! He turns his head as the Quentin he'd been talking to vanishes. The real Quentin drops his gun, lightly spasming]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>You can't trick me anymore.
</h1><h1>[The child grabs the glasses of Quentin's head while he falls to the ground]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>EDITH, turn off the drones.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b><i>Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter. Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?</i>
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Do it. Execute them all.
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b><i>Confirmed.</i>
</h1><h1>[All the drones fly back up to the satellite. Maria Hill watches from afar. We briefly cut to the vault]
</h1><h1><b>Happy: </b>Give me the spear.
</h1><h1>[While the weapon is passed over...]
</h1><h1><b>Ned Leeds: </b>That's a halberd.
</h1><h1>[Back to Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Thank you.
</h1><h1>[His face hardens as he turns to the dying Beck, lying on the ground]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>How could you do all of this?
</h1><h1><b>Quentin Beck: </b>(whispering) You'll see, Peter. People need to believe... And nowadays... <i>they'll believe anything.</i>
</h1><h1>[The con man doesn't move anymore. He appears to be dead]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>(to E.D.I.T.H.) Is he... Is this real?
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.: </b><i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>You can put me down now! You can put me down now!
</h1><h1>[The two of them land in the middle of New York City]
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>You okay?
</h1><h1>[She stumbles back, lightly disoriented]
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Whoo… Yeah! Yeah, I'm okay. Just.... Never, never doing that again. I'm never doing that again.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>Okay. Well, I should probably get out of here.
</h1><h1><b>MJ: </b>Be safe.
</h1><h1><b>Peter: </b>See you later.
</h1><h1>[Spider-Man jumps onto a nearby lamp post]
</h1><h1><b>Voice: </b>This is breaking news.
</h1><h1>[The camera pans around the superhero towards a enormous television screen, showing a news broadcast]
</h1><h1><b>Pat Kiernan</b>: <i>We come to you now with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video, it shows Quentin Beck, aka, Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing.</i>
</h1><h1>[Cut to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle. Mysterio's theme plays in the background]
</h1><h1><b>Mysterio</b>: <i>I managed to send the Elemental back into the dimensional rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponized drones, technology. He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.</i>
</h1><h1>[We're shown Quentin's death, but his superhero costume has been digitally added. The audio is different, too]
</h1><h1><b>E.D.I.T.H.</b>: <i>Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties.</i>
</h1><h1><b>Spider-Man</b>: <i>Do it! Execute them all!</i>
</h1><h1>[We hear the sound of drones firing and people screaming. While Peter and MJ watch, the newscaster comes back on screen]
</h1><h1><b>Pat Kiernan: </b>This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website, 'TheDailyBugle.net.
</h1><h1>[Cut to J. Jonah Jameson on the news screen, played by the one and only J.K. Simmons]
</h1><h1><b>J. Jonah Jameson</b>: <i>There you have it, folks. Conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio! An inter-dimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet, and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves, you might wanna sit down.</i>
</h1><h1>[Cut back to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle]
</h1><h1><b>Quentin</b> <b>Beck</b>: <i>Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is... Spider-Man's name is Peter!</i>
</h1><h1>[Peter's school picture fills the screen. Cut to Peter]
</h1><h1><b>Peter</b>: (horrified) WHAT THE F-
</h1><h1>[The credits go by with Michael Giacchino's killer score behind them. Once they've finished, we cut to a car being driven by Nick Fury, with Maria Hill sitting next to him. Their eyes briefly meet, before Maria Hill transforms into a Skrull, Soren, last seen in Captain Marvel]
</h1><h1><b>Soren: </b>You've got to tell him.
</h1><h1>[Nick Fury transforms into Talos, also from Captain Marvel]
</h1><h1><b>Talos: </b>(trying to comfort his wife) It was fine. The little boy handled it, we helped...
</h1><h1><b>Soren: </b>Talos.
</h1><h1><b>Talos: </b>(annoyed) Come on, Soren, how was I supposed to know the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very, very convincing, you know. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine!
</h1><h1>[While driving, he pulls out a smartphone to contact Fury. During the call, we see Talos in a POV shot, mimicking a phone camera]
</h1><h1><b>Talos: </b>Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to, about a week ago, like you said. And, uh, it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching.
</h1><h1><b>Soren (vo): </b>Talos.
</h1><h1><b>Talos: </b>And, uh, you know, shortly after that, everything kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back. Because everyone kept asking me where the Avengers are, and I don’t know what to say to that.
</h1><h1>[We cut to the real Nick Fury, resting on a beach, lying in a chair with a cocunut drink next to him]
</h1><h1><b>Talos: </b>So, you’re lucky…
</h1><h1>[Nick ends the call. He gets up and stretches out while the beach disappears, merely a hologram. He leaves a room, revealing that he is on a spaceship with several Skrulls. He walks to a huge window, showing the immensity of space]
</h1><h1><b>Nick Fury: </b>(claps his hands) Everybody, back to work! Who's got my shoes?
</h1><h1>[A last message shows a "dedicated to" message for Spider-Man's creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. After that, the movie ends]
